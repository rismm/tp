## Design

### Architecture
![ArchitectureDiagram](uml-diagrams/ArchitectureDiagram.png)\
The architecture diagram shown above explains the high-level design of SuperTracker

A quick overview of the main components:
- `Main`: In charge of program launch and shut down. Takes in user input and sends it to the `Parser` component.
Represented by the main class `SuperTracker`
- `Parser`: Parses user input into a command. Represented by the `Parser` class
- `Storage`: Reads data from and writes data to the hard disk
- `Ui`: Handles and prints output messages onto the CLI.
- `Command`: List of various commands. Classes in this component all implement the `Command` interface
- `Items`: Holds item and transaction data of the program in memory
  - Consists of `Item`, `Inventory`, `Transaction` and `TransactionList` classes

### Parser Component
The program handles user inputs in the Parser class where inputs are parsed into command classes that implement the Command interface. 
The Parser class only contains static methods as we have determined that it would be more practical instead of instantiating an instance of a Parser class.

> Note on the command inputs:
> - All valid command inputs by the user will have a command word _(first word separated by whitespace)_ with its respective parameters following the word.
> - Each parameter must be entered following a flag, i.e. a name parameter will have the input `n/NAME`

The following is a class diagram of the `Parser` and its relevant dependencies\
![ParserClass](uml-diagrams/ParserClass.png)

The following is a sequence diagram of the execution sequence of a single user input\
![ParserSequence](uml-diagrams/ParserSequence.png)

`Parser+parseCommand(input)` will return a `Command` object according to the command word in the user input.
It returns an `InvalidCommand` class if the command word detected is invalid.

For the parsing of valid command word inputs, `Parser+parseCommand(input)` passes the parameters of the user input into the respective command's parsing method, 
then calls the method `Parser-getPatternMatcher(regex, input, paramFlags)`that returns a `Matcher` object, which is Java's regex pattern matcher.
We use regular expressions to simplify the process of pattern matching for input parameters. Each command will have their respective regex strings for pattern matching

> Note that `Parser-getPatternMatcher(regex, input, paramFlags)` will be called as long as the command word in the user input is valid,
> even if the parameters are invalid. The `Matcher` object returned will try to match the input parameters to the given regex.
> A `TrackerException` will be thrown if the input parameters are invalid.

The input parameters will be passed into another method, `Parser-makeStringPattern(inputParam, paramFlags)` that returns a string in a pattern
according to a preset format that contains all the necessary input parameters.
Converting the parameter string to a pattern is done because **order does not matter** in the user's input parameters _(if there are multiple parameters)._
Thus, it would be necessary to convert the user's input into a consistent format for pattern matching using regex.

> Note: 
> - All command regex are in the format:\
>   `a/(?<grp1>.*) b/(?<grp2>.*) c/(?<grp3>.*) ` with `a/`, `b/`, `c/` being the respective parameter flags
>   and `/` as the flag character.
>   - Parameter flags can contain more than 1 character right before the `/`
>   - Suppose we have `a/aaa b/bbb c/ccc ` as an input, according to the regex above, 
>   aaa will be in the named capture group "grp1", bbb in "grp2", ccc in "grp3"
> - If a parameter is optional, we would have it in a non-capture group with a `?` at the end
>   - i.e. in `a/(?<grp1>.*) (?<grp2>(?:b/.*)?)`, the `b/` flag is an optional parameter
> - There also must be a white space before any valid input parameter flag in the user inputs
>   - i.e. in `a/(?<grp1>.*) (?<grp2>(?:b/.*)?)`, the input `a/__b/_` will take `__b/_` to be inside "grp1" and "grp2"
>   will be empty
> 
> For example, suppose the program wants to match the user input parameter
> `c/coconut a/apple b/bear a/anaconda d/donkey` to the regex `a/(?<grp1>.*) b/(?<grp2>.*) c/(?<grp3>.*) (?<grp4>(?:e/.*)?)`
> 1. The input parameter string and a string array of flags `{a, b, c, e}` is passed into `Parser-makeStringPattern(...)`
> 2. `Parser-makeStringPattern` will return a pattern string `a/apple b/bear c/coconut `
> 3. The program will then try to match the pattern string `a/apple b/bear c/coconut ` to the regex `
> a/(?<grp1>.*) b/(?<grp2>.*) c/(?<grp3>.*) (?<grp4>(?:e/.*)?)`
> 4. The above pattern string matches the regex, with the following strings in the named capture groups:
>    - "grp1": apple
>    - "grp2": bear
>    - "grp3": coconut
>    - "grp4": is empty

The `Matcher` will detect whether this input string pattern match the given regex pattern given to it
and extract out the necessary information if there is a match. 
This will be used by each command's respective parsing method and returns the relevant parsed `Command`
object to `SuperTracker+handleCommands()`

### Storage Component
Currently, the program handles 2 classes of save data, `Item` and `Transaction`.
Saving and loading data of these objects is performed by the `ItemStorage` and `TransactionStorage` classes that inherit
from the `FileManager` class. As the program is running, `Item` objects will be stored in the `Inventory` class,
while `Transaction` objects will be stored in the `TransactionList` class. 

#### Item objects
The following is a class diagram of `ItemStorage` and its relevant dependencies\
![ItemStorage](./uml-diagrams/ItemStorageClass.png)

Take note that the `Command` class in the diagram refers to the classes that implement the `Command` interface and make changes to the item list in `Inventory`

##### **Saving**
Saving is performed automatically each time the item list is updated. Currently, there are only 6 commands that can make changes to
the item list and will call `ItemStorage+saveData()` at the end of `CommandClass+execute()`.
> Commands that call `ItemStorage+saveData()` in `execute()`:
> - `NewCommand`
> - `UpdateCommand`
> - `DeleteCommand`
> - `AddCommand`
> - `RemoveCommand`
> - `RenameCommand`

Item data is saved into a text file in `./data/items.txt` by generating a string for each `Item` in the list, containing the attributes of the `item`.
The string generated will have the attributes in the format and order of `NAME,QUANTITY,PRICE,EXPIRY_DATE`. Since an `Item`'s expiry date is
optional, `EXPIRY_DATE` can be the string `"no date"` if the expiry date is determined to not exist. This string will be written to the text file as mentioned.
> For example, suppose the program wants to save the `Item` with attributes `name = "Apple"`, `quantity = 5`, `price = 2.55`, `expiryDate = 19-04-2024`
> and the program uses `",,,"` as a file delimiter between groups.\
> The program generates the string `"Apple ,,, 5 ,,, 2.55 ,,, 19-04-2024 ,,, end"` with `end` signifying the end of the data string.\
> Do note that the `end` is only a placeholder and can be any string of characters.
> > If for some reason the user was able to enter the file delimiter, such as `",,,"`, as an item name using the `new` or `rename` commands,
> > when the program saves, it will replace every occurrence of the file delimiter in the name to a placeholder character sequence, like `"*&_"`,
> > in the converted data string to prevent the program from saving data that is deemed corrupted on the next load.

This string is generated by the method `ItemStorage-getItemData()`

##### **Loading**
Loading is performed at the start of the program in `SuperTracker-run()` where it calls the method `ItemStorage+loadData()`.
`loadData()` looks for the save text file at `./data/items.txt` and reads the lines from the file `items.txt` if it exists. As indicated earlier,
each line containing a single `Item`'s data will be in the format and order of `NAME,QUANTITY,PRICE,EXPIRY_DATE`. Each attribute will be parsed into its
relevant data type, creating a new `Item` with the extracted attributes, which is then added to the item list in `Inventory`. In the event where the line
of data read is not in the correct format, or the attributes are unable to be parsed into its relevant data type _(i.e. the string in the QUANTITY part reads "f1ve" instead of "5")_,
the line will be ignored and a new `Item` will not be added to the list. The corrupted lines of data will also be erased from the save file.

The parsing of string data to an `Item` object is handled by the method `ItemStorage-parseItemData()`.

#### Transaction objects
The following is a class diagram of `TransactionStorage` and its relevant dependencies\
![TransactionStorage](uml-diagrams/TransactionStorageClass.png)

Take note that the `Command` class in the diagram refers to the classes that implement the `Command` interface and add transactions to list in `TransactionList`

The saving and loading is largely similar to that of Item objects detailed above.

##### **Saving**
Currently, there are only 3 commands that can make changes to
the item list and will call `TransactionStorage+saveTransaction()` at the end of `CommandClass+execute()`.
> Commands that call `TransactionStorage+saveTransaction()` in `execute()`:
> - `BuyCommand`
> - `SellCommand`
> - `ClearCommand`

Transaction data is saved into a text file in `./data/transactions.txt` by generating a string the newly added `Transaction` in the list, containing the attributes of the `Transaction`.
The string generated will have the attributes in the format and order of `NAME,QUANTITY,PRICE,TRANSACTION_DATE,TYPE`. This string will be appended to the end of the data file as mentioned.
If the data file does not exist while the program calls `TransactionStorage+saveTransaction()`, the data file will be recreated and all transaction data
currently in the program will be re-saved using the string format above in the method `TransactionStorage-saveAllTransactions()`. If the user clears transaction data, the program calls the
method `TransactionStorage+resaveAllTransactions()` instead which rewrites the whole save file using the same methods as above with all transactions in the list.
> For example, suppose the program wants to save the `Transaction` with attributes `name = "Apple"`, `quantity = 5`, `price = 2.55`, `transactionDate = 19-04-2024, type = "s"`
> and the program uses `",,,"` as a file delimiter between groups.\
> The program generates the string `"NAME: Apple ,,, QTY: 5 ,,, PRICE: 2.55 ,,, DATE: 19-04-2024 ,,, T: s ,,, end"` with `end` signifying the end of the data string.\
> Do note that the `end` is only a placeholder and can be any string of characters.
> > To justify why the saved string format is different from `Item` objects, the save file of `Transaction` objects can also act as a receipt of the user's expenses, thus it is made more readable.

The string is generated by the method `TransactionStorage-getTransactionData()`

##### **Loading**
`SuperTracker.run()` calls `TransactionStorage+loadTransactionData()` at the beginning of the program.
`loadTransactionData` looks for the save file `./data/transactions.txt` and reads the lines from `transactions.txt` if it exists. The attributes
of a `Transaction` is extracted from the line and a new `Transaction` object is created and put in the `TransactionList` class. Similar to loading `Item` data,
corrupted `Transaction` data will be dealt with accordingly.
> Note: Including the criteria for corrupted data in `Item` data, if a transaction date has been edited such that the new date is of a date that has not occurred yet,
> _(e.g. changing a date from today to 1 year from today)_, this will also be treated as corrupted 'Transaction' data.

- `Ui`: To print the list of items in the inventory to the output

The 7 parameters in the constructor `firstParam`, `secondParam`, `thirdParam`, `firstSortParam`, `secondSortParam`, `thirdSortParam`, `isReverse` 
are used to determine how the list should be printed out.
- `firstParam`,`secondParam`,`thirdParam`
  - Used to determine if quantity, price and/or expiry date should be printed out and in what order  
    e.g. If the command specifies `list q/ p/ e/`, for each item quantity will be printed out first followed by price and expiry date
  - Can only take 4 possible values `"q"`,`"p"`,`"e"`,`""`
  - Value corresponds to the order of the flags in the command  
    e.g. If the command specifies `list p/ e/ q/`, then `firstParam == "p"`, `secondParam == "e"`, `thirdParam == "q"` 
  - `""` will be the default value if there are less than 3 flags in the command  
    e.g. If the command specifies `list e/`, then `firstParam == "e"`, `secondParam == ""`, `thirdParam == ""`
- `firstSortParam`,`secondSortParam`,`thirdSortParam`
  - Used to determine how the list should be sorted and in what order in the event of ties  
    e.g. If the command specifies `list sq/ sp/ se/`, list will be sorted in order of ascending quantity.
    Ties will be sorted in order of ascending price, then ascending date, followed by ascending alphabetical order (A-Z)
  - Can only take 4 possible values `"q"`,`"p"`,`"e"`,`""`
  - Value corresponds to the order of the sorting flags in the command  
    e.g. If the command specifies `list sp/ se/ sq/`, then `firstSortParam == "p"`, `secondSortParam == "e"`, `thirdSortParam == "q"`
  - `""` will be the default value if there are less than 3 flags in the command  
    e.g. If the command specifies `list se/`, then `firstSortParam == "e"`, `secondSortParam == ""`, `thirdSortParam == ""`
- `isReverse`
  - True if the user has input the reverse flag `r/`, false otherwise.

There are 8 main sorting modes in total
1. `list`: Alphabetical ascending (e.g. A-Z)
2. `list r/`: Alphabetical descending (e.g. Z-A)
3. `list sq/`: Quantity ascending
4. `list sq/ r/`: Quantity descending
5. `list sp/`: Price ascending
6. `list sp/ r/`: Price descending
7. `list se/`: Expiry date ascending (e.g. 2024-2025)
8. `list se/ r/`: Expiry date descending (e.g. 2025-2024)

A ReportCommand instance is created by the `parseReportCommand` method called by Parser, which parses the user input to determine how the report should be printed out.

#### Dependencies
- `Item`: For getting the comparator needed to sort the list of items
- `Inventory`: For getting the list of items in the inventory
- `Ui`: To print the list of items in the inventory to the output

There are 2 types of reports:
1. `report r/low stock t/threshold`: Lists all items that are low on stock based on the threshold
2. `report r/expiry`: Lists all items that have expired or are 1 week to expiring

The following sequence diagram shows the execution of a ReportCommand<br>
![ReportCommandSequence](uml-diagrams/ReportCommandSequence.png)

1. The `SuperTracker` class calls the `execute` method of `ReportCommand`
2. The `getItems` method of the `Inventory` class is called to get an `ArrayList` of items in the inventory
3. There is an alternative path check for whether the list of items is empty. 
If it is `ReportCommand` calls the method `reportNoItems` of the `Ui` class. If it is not it calls `reportHasItemsExecute` of the `Ui` class.
4. In the `reportHasItemsExecute` method, there is an alternative path check for the type of report. 
If its of type "low stock" it calls the method `createLowStockReport` of `ReportCommand` class. If its of type "expiry" it calls the method `createExpiryReport` of the `ReportCommand` class.
5. In `createLowStockReport`, for each item in items it checks if the item's quantity is below the threshold requirement. 
If it is, it is added to the report. At the end, the report is sorted by quantity using the ArrayList sort method and the method `reportCommandSuccess` of the `Ui` class is called for the report.
6. In `createExpiryReport`, for each item in items it checks if the item's expiry date is between the present day and a week later or has already passed 
and adds the item to 2 different reports if the respective requirements are met. At the end, both reports are sorted by their expiry dates
using the ArrayList sort method and 2 instances of the method `reportCommandSuccess` of the `ReportCommand` class is called for each report.

## Appendix: Instructions for manual testing

### Saving data
Dealing with corrupted data files
- Prerequisite: Existing data files `items.txt` and `transactions.txt` in the `./data/` directory. Multiple valid lines of data in text files.
- **For item data:**\
In the text file `items.txt`, with valid lines of data being `name ,,, quantity ,,, price ,,, dd-MM-yyyy ,,, end`
  - For corrupted data
    1. Remove a file delimiter (the `,,,` character sequence) on any valid data line
    2. Replace an existing number in any data line (quantity or price) with a negative number
    3. In any data line with an existing expiry date, replace the `"-"` with `"/"`
    - Expected behaviour: Relaunch the program. On start, the program should output an error message
    indicating that there were corrupted lines of data. Re-open `items.txt` and the lines that were edited should be
    deleted.
  - For duplicate item data,
    1. Take an existing valid line of data and duplicate it to the bottom of the text file
    2. Replace its quantity and price with any valid positive number different from the original
    - Expected behaviour: Relaunch the program. On start, the program should output a message indicating that
    it detected duplicate item data, and the name of the duplicated item is specified. Use `find n/NAME` with name
    being the name of the duplicated item. The displayed item should have the quantity and price of the duplicated line of data.
    - Can also try: adding multiple duplicated items to the text file
- **For transaction data:**\
In the text file `transaction.txt`, with valid lines of data being `NAME: name ,,, QTY: quantity ,,, PRICE: price ,,, DATE: date ,,, T: type ,,, end`
  - For corrupted data
    1. Can use the test cases from item data text file, `items.txt` data corruption as well
    2. Replace the type in any valid line of data to anything that is not `b` or `s`
    3. Delete any one of `NAME:`, `QTY:`, `PRICE:` `DATE:`, `T:` in any valid line of data
    - Expected behaviour: Relaunch the program. On start, the program should output an error message
    indicating that there were corrupted lines of data. Re-open `transactions.txt` and the lines that were edited should be
    deleted.
  - Additionally, to any valid line of data, replace the transaction date to a date far into the future, i.e. `01-01-2999`
    - Expected behaviour: Relaunch the program. Similarly, the program should output an error message
    indicating that there were corrupted lines of data. There should also be an additional message that tells the user
    that the date edited is a date that has not happened yet. The edited line of data should also be deleted from `transactions.txt`

> Note: Run all the test cases below consecutively for accurate results. 
> Start off by deleting all text in `data/items.txt` and `data/transactions.txt`.

### Create a new item
Test case: `new n/Pie q/20 p/3 e/19-04-2024`

Expected: Pie is successfully added to the inventory
```
Pie has been added to the inventory!
Quantity: 20
Price: $3.00
Expiry Date: 19/04/2024
```

Test case: `new n/Pie q/20 p/3 e/20-04-2024`

Expected: Pie is unable to be added as it already exists in the inventory
```
Oh no! An error has occurred
Pie already exists in inventory. Use the update command instead.
```

### Delete an item
Test case: `delete n/Pie`

Expected: Pie is successfully deleted from the inventory
```
Pie has been deleted!
```

Test case: `delete n/pie`

Expected: pie is unable to be deleted as it does not exist in the inventory 
```
Oh no! An error has occurred
pie does not exist in inventory. Unable to delete something that does not exist. =(
```

### Increase quantity
Before this test case, run `new n/Pie q/100 p/3 e/19-04-2024`

Test case: `add n/Pie q/200`

Expected: Quantity of Pie is increased to 300
```
200 Pie added to inventory!
Quantity: 300
```

Test case: `add n/Pie q/2147483647`

Expected: Unable to increase quantity of Pie due to integer overflow
```
Oh no! An error has occurred
Unable to add your specified number of items. Why do you need more than 2147483647 items anyway?
```

### Decrease quantity
Test case: `remove n/Pie q/100`

Expected: Quantity of Pie is decreased to 200
```
100 Pie removed from inventory!
Quantity: 200
```

Test case: `remove n/Pie q/300`

Expected: Quantity of Pie is decreased to 0 as the quantity given in the command exceeds the current quantity of Pie
```
200 Pie removed from inventory!
Quantity: 0
```

Test case: `remove n/Pie q/1`

Expected: Quantity of Pie remains at 0 as quantity cannot be negative
```
No Pie removed as you don't have any!
```
